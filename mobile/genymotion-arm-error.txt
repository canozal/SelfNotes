# Genymotion APK Installation Error Solution

Error: "An error occurred while deploying the file. This probably means that the app contains ARM native code and your Genymotion device cannot run ARM instructions."

So we need to install ARM translation on the emulator.

$ Download the right ARM translation archive for your device’s Android version. 
  https://github.com/m9rco/Genymotion_ARM_Translation/tree/master/package
  
$ Drag and drop the .zip file to the device’s unlocked screen and click on OK when asked for confirmation

Now you should be able to install any app even if it has ARM code.
