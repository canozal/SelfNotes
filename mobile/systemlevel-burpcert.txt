# Installing Burp CA certificate on the android device at SYSTEM level.

If the requests do not drop to BurpSuite during mobile pentests and "The Client failed to negotiate an SSL Connection" error is received on the Burp Dashboard screen; the problem can be solved by installing the Burp CA certificate on the mobile device at SYSTEM level.

On Nougat (Android 7.0) and above systems, it is no longer possible to catch requests made by the mobile app with the traditional USER-level certificate installation process. 

HOWTO

	$ openssl x509 -inform DER -in cacert.der -out cacert.pem
	$ openssl x509 -inform PEM -subject_hash_old -in cacert.pem |head -1
	$ mv cacert.pem <hash>.0

	$ adb root
	$ adb remount
	$ adb push <cert>.0 /sdcard/

	$ mv /sdcard/<cert>.0 /system/etc/security/cacerts/
	$ chmod 644 /system/etc/security/cacerts/<cert>.0
